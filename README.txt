Made by nlgzrgn
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:
(Almost every option can be edited from .ini file.)

-- Lap count restrictions are modified.
> You can have from 0 (which makes the race unlimited) to 127 (Really long races) laps.

-- Opponent count can now be selected from Track Options menu.
> The game supports from 0 (forever alone) to 3 (regular race) opponents.

! Some menus have 5 options. The last updated option (4th or 5th) will appear over 4th option.

> This mod is fully functional. I don't know why EA cut it from the final game.
! This option will replace Free Run mode.

-- You can have every track on every game mode.
> This will make the list too long. But you can select the races safely.
! This option will also unlock Test Track.
> You can control it with a hotkey. Enable it when you want.

-- You can change the time limit of Splash Screen.
> 30 seconds aren't enough? Make it a minute, an hour, maybe a day!

> Birds eye? Yeah, it's here!
